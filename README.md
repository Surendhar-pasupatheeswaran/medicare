In that situation there arise another problem that people were suspended temporarily from their jobs. This makes them to feel more difficult. To get their daily groceries they need money. Without job they need not have salary. So that out government had planned to fund them with 2000. This is not enough to lead their life. If they got diseased they will definitely go for government hospital rather than going for private hospitals. Basically the government hospital infrastructure is based only for few people. But in this case if everyone seeking the help of government hospital there will arise a problem called “loss of infrastructure”.
